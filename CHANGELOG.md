## v0.8.0-rc1
* Elliptic curve API has been significantly changed [#120]
  
  In particular: ECPoint, ECScalar traits were redesigned. They remain,
  but are not supposed to be used directly anymore. In replacement,
  we introduce structures Point, Scalar representing elliptic point and
  scalar. See curv::elliptic::curves module-level documentation to learn 
  more.
* Add low degree exponent interpolation proof [#119]
